## Overview
ScholarAI is an all-in-one platform for academic and career success, powered by cutting-edge AI. Built with Next.js and Firebase, it offers tools for resume building, note generation, document summarization, and quiz creationâ€”all in one place. The site uses Firebase for user authentication and is deployed on Vercel for seamless hosting.



## Features
- **Resume Builder**: Build your resume with the help of an AI chatbot. Get real-time feedback and suggestions from AI, and have your resume reviewed for improvements. (Note: Multiple templates are not available; the focus is on AI-driven guidance and review.)

  
- **AI Note Generator**: Generate structured, concise notes from your study materials using AI. The tool can summarize, organize, and highlight key points from any text or uploaded document, and you can interact with the AI for clarifications or deeper explanations.
- **Document Summarizer**: Summarize long documents and articles with AI. The summarizer extracts the most important information, provides bullet-point overviews, and can answer follow-up questions about the content.
- **AI Quiz Creator**: Create customized quizzes from your study materials. Choose question types (multiple choice, true/false, etc.), set difficulty, and let AI generate questions. The quiz creator supports both text and PDF input, and provides instant feedback on your answers.

## Mobile App
We also built a mobile app with similar functionality, so users can choose between the web or app version depending on their usability and preference.
