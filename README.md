## Overview
ScholarAI is an all-in-one platform for academic and career success, powered by cutting-edge AI. Built with Next.js and Firebase, it offers tools for resume building, note generation, document summarization, and quiz creationâ€”all in one place. The site uses Firebase for user authentication and is deployed on Vercel for seamless hosting.


## Features
- **Resume Builder**: Craft professional resumes with intuitive templates and live preview.
- **AI Note Generator**: Generate structured, concise notes from text 
- **Document Summarizer**: Quickly summarize long documents and articles.
- **AI Quiz Creator**: Create customized quizzes from study materials to test knowledge.

## Mobile App
We also built a mobile app with similar functionality, so users can choose between the web or app version depending on their usability and preference.

**Tech Stack:**
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Gemini API
- Koin (for dependency injection)

Both the web and mobile app provide the same core features for academic and career success.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (for login authentication)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
